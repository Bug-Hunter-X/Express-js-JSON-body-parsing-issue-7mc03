# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises when the `express.json()` middleware fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON data, resulting in an empty `req.body` object.

## Problem Description

A simple Express.js application is designed to receive and process JSON data from a POST request. Despite using `express.json()`, the application fails to parse the JSON payload, causing `req.body` to be empty.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the proper configuration and usage of the `express.json()` middleware. This ensures that Express.js is correctly parsing and handling the JSON data within the request body.
